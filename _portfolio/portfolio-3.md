This project replicates and interprets the results of the Matias D. Cattaneo, Sebastian Galiani, Paul J. Gertler, Sebastian Martinez, and Rocio Titunik’s (2009) “[Housing, Health, and Happiness](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.1.1.75)” study. 


## I &nbsp; Summary
&nbsp; The paper concerns the impact of Piso Firme, a program that provided resources for low-income families in the State of Coahuila, Mexico to replace the dirt floors in their homes with cement floors. This study primarily focuses on quantifying the changes in parasitic infestations in young children, maternal happiness, and the subsequent long-term effects on the families’ health and welfare due to the administration of Piso Firme.

&nbsp;	The study found that Piso Firme not only significantly decreased the prevalence of parasitic infestations, anemia, and diarrhea in young children but also improved their cognitive development as well. In addition, the study also discovered that the adults of the household also experience a substantial improvement in mental health and quality of life. 

## II &nbsp; Data Description 
&nbsp;	This study utilizes a cross-sectional household survey detailing the variables of interest in both the treatment groups (families residing in Torreón on the border of the State of Coahuila) who participated in Piso Firme and control groups (families residing in Lerdo/Gómez Palacios on the border of the State of Durango) who did not participate in Piso Firme at the time of observation. The study received 1390 completed surveys in the treatment area and 1393 completed surveys in the control area, resulting in a response rate of about 93% in both groups. Detailed information was collected concerning “household demographic structure, socioeconomic status, housing infrastructure (including detailed information on the type of floor in each room of the house), health outcomes, and cognitive development of children less than six years old, as well as happiness and mental health indicators for their mothers” (Matias D. Cattaneo et al. 2009). 

## III &nbsp; Summary Statistics Tables and Interpretations
&nbsp;	The replication of Table 3 below details the number of observations, means, and standard errors for every independent variable in the treatment and control groups. It also includes the difference in both the means and the standard errors, which we can see are relatively small. This indicates that our treatment and control groups were well-balanced at the time when data was collected. However, we will account for these slight differences between the two groups during our analysis.
