## I     Problem Description 
Throughout the years, there has been a dramatic increase in drug overdoses. We are currently at the point where overdoses are the cause of more deaths than car accidents, guns, or HIV. [1] Since 1999, there have been about 1 million fatal overdoses in the United States and just within the past year, over 100,000 have lost their lives due to overdose. [2] It is very clear that the drug epidemic is a widespread societal problem that needs to be properly researched and addressed. 
To do so, our team will be analyzing the number of fatal overdoses in United States counties throughout the last 20 years and exploring the question: Which characteristics of U.S. counties can best explain drug overdose rates? We also hope to estimate overdose rates in the counties that are missing data in our main overdose dataset. The successful completion of these tasks will allow us to provide policy makers with valuable information about the areas of the U.S. that are not easily observed simply with the raw overdose counts as well as insight as to what factors to focus on and which communities should be addressed more urgently when trying to counteract the drug overdose epidemic.

Data Generation 
Our team obtained our drug overdose data from the CDC Wonder Search website by requesting data that specifically pertains to overdoses using their “underlying cause of death” codes. [3] The CDC collected this data through the Vital Statistics Cooperative to provide health departments and the general public with open access to detailed information that is beneficial in public health research and decision making.
