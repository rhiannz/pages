<p style="font-size: 23px">
  I am actively looking for a full-time job in a data-oriented role. As a recent graduate of the UC Berkeley MA Statistics program, I am trained in modern statistical and machine learning methods and have an undergraduate background in mathematics. I also have experience with languages and software such as Python, R, and SQL. I look forward to any opportunities to grow and contribute to others!
