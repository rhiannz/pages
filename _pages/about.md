Hello! I am actively looking for a job as data analyst. As a recent graduate of the UC Berkeley MA Statistics program, I am looking forward to opportunities to grow and contribute to others! Feel free to check out some of the projects I have done : )

# Projects 

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-1/" style="font-size: 38px; color: black; text-decoration: none;">Geospatial Explanatory Modeling of the U.S. Drug Overdose Epidemic</a>

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-1/"><img src='/images/overdose_cover.png' alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:700px;height:auto;"></a>

Throughout the years, there has been a dramatic increase in drug overdoses. We are currently at the point where overdoses are the cause of more deaths than car accidents, guns, or HIV. [1] Since 1999, there have been about 1 million fatal overdoses in the United States and just within the past year, over 100,000 have lost their lives due to overdose. [2] It is very clear that the drug epidemic is a widespread societal problem that needs to be properly researched and addressed...

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io/AP-Participation/" style="font-size: 38px; color: black; text-decoration: none;">An Analysis of AP Exam Participation Rates</a>

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io/AP-Participation/"><img src='/images/ap_cover.png' alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:700px;height:auto;"></a>

Every year, millions of students take AP Exams in over 30 different subjects. These rigorous tests grant high school students the opportunity to earn early college credits if they receive a score of 3 or higher. And when they reach college, these early credits allow students to skip introductory classes, free up their class schedules, and allow for more flexibility to explore other courses and majors, study abroad, pursue a second degree, or graduate early. However, all AP students, even those...

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-3/" style="font-size: 36px; color: black; text-decoration: none;">Replication of “Piso Firme” Program Impact Investigation</a>

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-3/"><img src='/images/hhh_cover.png' alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:700px;height:auto;"></a>

The paper concerns the impact of Piso Firme, a program that provided resources for low-income families in the State of Coahuila, Mexico to replace the dirt floors in their homes with cement floors. This study primarily focuses on quantifying the changes in parasitic infestations in young children, maternal happiness, and the subsequent long-term effects on the families’ health and welfare due to the administration of Piso Firme...

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-4/" style="font-size: 42px; color: black; text-decoration: none;">genetic-selectR Package Development</a>

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-4/"><img src='/images/ga_cover.png' alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:700px;height:auto;"></a>

In this project, we created a R package implementing genetic algorithms for variable selection in regression problems, including both linear regression and GLMs. We allow users to choose their own fitness functions and by default it’s AIC. Several genetic operators, such as crossover and mutation are combined into this whole selection process. We test all of our functions using different datasets and criteria. The results of our package are shown...

# Research Experience 

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//research/" style="font-size: 42px; color: black; text-decoration: none;">Persistent Homology and Student Typing Patterns</a>

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//research/"><img src='/images/ph_cover.png' alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:700px;height:auto;"></a>

This research project utilizes persistent homology to examine student typing data collected from online proctoring sites and identify trends indicating academic misconduct. Topological data analysis is applied to evaluate the algebraic facets of the persistence of holes in a given space and display high dimensional data trends. The following report will explain the general background information behind Persistent Homology, the code used to study ...
