<p style="font-size: 23px">
  Hello! I am actively looking for a full-time job in a data-oriented role. As a recent graduate of the UC Berkeley MA Statistics program, I am trained in modern statistical and machine learning methods and have an undergraduate background in mathematics. I also have experience with languages and software such as Python, R, and SQL. I look forward to any opportunities to grow and contribute to others! Feel free to check out some of the things I have worked on : )

# Projects 

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-1/" style="font-size: 38px; color: black; text-decoration: none;">Geospatial Explanatory Modeling of the U.S. Drug Overdose Epidemic</a>

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-1/"><img src='/images/overdose_cover.png' alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:700px;height:auto;"></a>

Throughout the years, there has been a dramatic increase in drug overdoses. We are currently at the point where overdoses are the cause of more deaths than car accidents, guns, or HIV. Since 1999, there have been about 1 million fatal overdoses in the United States and just within the past year, over 100,000 have lost their lives due to overdose...

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io/AP-Participation/" style="font-size: 39px; color: black; text-decoration: none;">An Analysis of AP Exam Participation Rates</a>

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io/AP-Participation/"><img src='/images/ap_cover.png' alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:700px;height:auto;"></a>

Every year, millions of students take AP Exams in over 30 different subjects. These rigorous tests grant high school students the opportunity to earn early college credits if they receive a score of 3 or higher. And when they reach college, these early credits allow students to skip introductory classes, free up their class schedules, and ...

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-3/" style="font-size: 42px; color: black; text-decoration: none;">Replication of “Piso Firme” Program Impact Investigation</a>

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-3/"><img src='/images/hhh_cover.png' alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:700px;height:auto;"></a>

The paper concerns the impact of Piso Firme, a program that provided resources for low-income families in the State of Coahuila, Mexico to replace the dirt floors in their homes with cement floors. This study primarily focuses on quantifying the changes in parasitic infestations in young children, maternal happiness, and the subsequent long-term effects on...

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-4/" style="font-size: 44px; color: black; text-decoration: none;">genetic-selectR Package Development</a>

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-4/"><img src='/images/ga_cover.png' alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:700px;height:auto;"></a>

In this project, we created an R package implementing genetic algorithms that efficiently selects the most optimized combination of covariates from multidimensional datasets for generalized linear modeling. We allow users to choose their own fitness functions and several different genetic operators, such as crossover and mutation. We also tested...

# Research Experience 

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//research/" style="font-size: 43px; color: black; text-decoration: none;">Persistent Homology and Student Typing Patterns</a>

<a href="https://rhiannz.github.io//research/"><img src='/images/ph_cover.png' alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:700px;height:auto;"></a>

This research project utilizes persistent homology to examine student typing data collected from online proctoring sites and identify trends indicating academic misconduct. Topological data analysis is applied to evaluate the algebraic facets of the persistence of holes in a given space and display high dimensional data trends. The following...
